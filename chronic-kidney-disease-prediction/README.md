## About Chronic Kidney Disease Prediction Using Naive Bayes ALgorithm

The Chronic Kidney Disease Prediction system is a web-based system that helps patient keep 
track of their kidney health. It works by collecting information about the patient's health and 
using data mining algorithms to analyze the information and make predictions about the 
patient's condition. This system helps patient to make faster and more accurate diagnoses, and 
can be used from a distance. The goal is to make it easier for patient to keep track of their 
health and help them understand their medical status.

##Problem Statement
• People with chronic diseases have a higher risk of health problems and unequal access to 
healthcare.
• Lack of technology to monitor and track health care for these diseases makes it difficult 
and time-consuming.
• Health measurements and records are often recorded on paper, which can lead to missing 
information.
• Patients with chronic diseases struggle to choose diets and exercise plans that are right for 
them.
• Society needs to improve health care and outcomes for people with chronic diseases


## Objective

• To reduce the chances of CKD leading to dialysis or kidney transplantation.
• Replace paper measurement recording with a database in the application
• Allow patients to view medical records and progress
• Use data mining and machine learning algorithms to build the model
• Focus on chronic kidney diseases by using Naive Bayes algorithms.
• Provide experimental results and analysis to measure accuracy
